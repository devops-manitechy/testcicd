Version Control: Start by hosting your project code in a version control system like Git.

CI/CD Tool Setup: Choose a CI/CD tool like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions. For this example, let's use Jenkins.

Pipeline Configuration: Create a Jenkinsfile in the root of your project directory. This file defines the stages and steps of your CI/CD pipeline.

Dockerfile: Create a Dockerfile in the root of your project directory. This file defines how to build your Docker image.

CI Stage (Build): In your Jenkinsfile, define a stage to build the Docker image. This stage should execute the Docker build command to build the image using the Dockerfile.

CD Stage (Push): Define another stage to push the built Docker image to a Docker registry like Docker Hub, AWS ECR, or Azure Container Registry.

Pipeline Execution: Configure your Jenkins instance to execute the pipeline whenever changes are pushed to your version control repository.
